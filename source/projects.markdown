## Project Development

* Rotate teams every two weeks
* Sometimes, they take on an existing code base from another team
* Winner gets first pick, but can't choose their own

## Project Ideas

The projects they work on probably aren't important, but here are a few ideas:

* Content Management System
* Ticket Vendor / Event Scheduler
* Private Messaging Service
